# Introduction

This is the core part of the Java Client Library for Sirius Test Automation Platform. It is designed to be the top-most entry point for all Java client components. Additionally, it contains methods interacting with the internal Sirius Server endpoints.

# Project Documentation

| Resource | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Project Documentation Home Page](/Sirius/sirius.java.client/index.html) | The home page for generated Maven site containing major technical documentation for the module |
| [Project Reports Page](/Sirius/sirius.java.client/project-reports.html) | The home page for generated Maven site containing major analysis reports for the module |
| [Project Javadoc Page](/Sirius/sirius.java.client/apidocs/index.html) | The home page for generated Maven site containing major Javadoc documentation for the module  |

# Installation

The client library is delivered in 2 ways:

1. Self-contained Java library provided as **jar** file. It can be taken from [downloads page](http://code.google.com/p/sirius-platform/downloads/list). All we need to do is just unpack the archive and include appropriate **jar** file into the project.

2. Maven dependencies. Each client module is also published to Maven repository. The list of available modules can be found on [the following page](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.github.mkolisnyk%22). So, if we have Maven project where we'd like to use Sirius Java client libraries we should update Maven script with the entry like this:
{% highlight xml linenos=table %}
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.github.mkolisnyk</groupId>
		<artifactId>sirius.java.client</artifactId>
		<version>LATEST</version>
	</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}
or any similar for all the modules we'd like to include.

After that we can use library classes, e.g:

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
	// TBD
{% endhighlight %}

# Sample usage
